# Windows-Update-Assistent
The Windows Update  Assistant is a batch file and vbscript combo. It's purpose is to cut down on the human interaction needed for bulk updating windows machines. This script is still being worked on so expect some issues when running it. 

Please note that while the batch script is my own work the vbscript is not. I edited a vbscript that I found on Stack Overflow and will continue to optimize it.
